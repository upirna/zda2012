We have organized an excursion where we will enrich our knowledge and competences that we have gathered throughout our five years of studies.";

    echo "On 15th of March we will land in Los Angeles and start feeling the difference between Slovenian and American way of life. Our next stop will be Silicon Valley, which is home to many of the world's largest technology corporations and continues to be the leading hub for high-tech innovation and development. We are going to visit more than ten high-tech corporations. But Silicone Valley and its surroundings is not only a high-tech center, it also offers great Universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. We have decided to visit them, because college premises such as libraries, laboratories and dormitories are much bigger and richer that in Europe, especially in Slovenia. After Silicone Valley experience we want to visit some of the amazing natural parks, with which USA can show off. After that we’ll take a flight from Las Vegas to Washington. In Washington we are going to visit Pentagon, which is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, and the White House, which is the official residence and principal workplace of the president of the United States. Our journey will end in the most popular city in the United States – New York City. We will take a bite of the Big Apple and at the end we’ll take a flight back home to Europe.";
